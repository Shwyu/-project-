What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

**GPFA method for analyzing the activities of Neurons and how this methods improve the prediction compared to two-stage methods.**

Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

**Learn and try to develop some novel models that could be utilized in neuroscience experiments, and how we can decode the spike data to predict the decisions**

What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

**We may change the packages and code we use for making the models about GPFA. Also, we are trying use the IBL dataset for further analysis**

What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

**EM algorithm.**
